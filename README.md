#Jimmy's Complete Vim Setup#

Here is my complete vim set up.

~/.vimrc is linked to ./vimrc. 

All the plugins are licensed under their respective licenses.  
Anything I wrote is licensed under your choice of 2-Clause BSD or MIT/Expat

**Note:** This repo used to use git submodules but they are broken.
Run 'get_bundles.sh' to get the plugins I use.
